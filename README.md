Welcome to stock-o-matic, making you ridiculous amounts of money on Wall Street!


Let's keep it simple: Here's a list of files and what they do (the files they talk to in parenthesis like this)

main.java - some dumb file that has no functionality (talks to nothing because it is nothing)
parse_html.py - a python script that quickly gets all the stock ticker names on finviz (thank you to devon)
finvizscraper.py - a python script that systematically pulls all these stock tickers
